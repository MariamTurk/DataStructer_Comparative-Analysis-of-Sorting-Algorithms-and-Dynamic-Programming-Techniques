# 📘 Comparative Analysis of Sorting Algorithms and Dynamic Programming Techniques

## 🧾 Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive academic report analyzing and comparing three well-known sorting algorithms—**Quick Sort**, **Counting Sort**, and **Comb Sort**—as well as an introduction to **Dynamic Programming** concepts.

The report discusses each algorithm in detail, including:
- Pseudocode
- Step-by-step execution examples
- Time and space complexity analysis
- Visual illustrations
- Applications and use-cases

It also introduces **Dynamic Programming** through real-world problems such as:
- Fibonacci number generation
- Coin Change Problem
- Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
